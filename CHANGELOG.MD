#### `Jun 05, 2017`

#### Added `generact` to scaffold new components.â€¨<br>
#### Added redux in this branch and kept bootstrap v4;
Feel free to strucutre your code as you find fit. My recommendations: <br>
	- For a small app: separate by type: `/containers` `/actions` `/reducers`
	- For medium/bigger apps: separate by feature: `/report` `/report/action.js`, etc
